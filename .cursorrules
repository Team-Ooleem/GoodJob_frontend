# Good Job – AI Mock Interview Platform

## Project Rules for Next.js-based AI Mock Interview Service Development

---

## 📁 Project Structure & Architecture

- All page routing must be created under the `src/app/` directory.
- Common/shared resources should be placed in centralized folders:
    - `src/components/` → **Global UI components**
    - `src/apis/` → **Shared API functions**
    - `src/constants/` → **Global constants**
    - `src/utils/` → **Common utility functions (grouped by functionality)**

- Route-specific or feature-specific resources should be placed in underscore-prefixed folders within their respective route directories:
    - `src/app/users/_components/` → **Page-specific components**
    - `src/app/interview/_lib/` → **Page-specific utility functions**
    - `src/app/interview/_apis/` → **Page-specific API functions**

- Use `[id]` folder naming convention for dynamic routes.

## 🎨 Design System & Styling

### UI Component Library

- **Primary**: Use **Ant Design (antd)** components for all basic UI elements
- **Secondary**: Use **Tailwind CSS** for custom styling, layout, and spacing

### Design System Guidelines

#### Ant Design Components (우선 사용)

- **Basic Components**: Button, Input, Form, Table, Modal, Card, Typography
- **Data Display**: DatePicker, Select, Upload, Tree, Timeline
- **Layout**: Layout, Grid, Space, Divider
- **Feedback**: Message, Notification, Spin, Progress, Alert
- **Navigation**: Menu, Breadcrumb, Pagination, Steps

#### Tailwind CSS (추가 스타일링)

- **Layout & Spacing**: Use Tailwind for margins, padding, positioning
- **Responsive Design**: Implement responsive breakpoints
- **Custom Styling**: Override or extend Ant Design components when needed
- **Color Consistency**: Use Ant Design's design tokens for colors and spacing

#### Best Practices

- **Component Priority**: Always check if Ant Design has a suitable component before creating custom ones
- **Consistency**: Maintain visual consistency with Ant Design's design language
- **Accessibility**: Leverage Ant Design's built-in accessibility features
- **Customization**: Use Tailwind classes to customize Ant Design components when necessary

## 🧠 State Management

- Client state is managed using `Zustand` (e.g., user authentication, UI state).
- Server state is managed using `@tanstack/react-query` (e.g., interview data, user profiles).
- Global context providers should be placed in the `src/providers/` directory.

---

## 📝 Form & Validation

- Use `react-hook-form` for all form handling.
- Define form validation rules using `Zod` schemas.
- Integrate Zod with React Hook Form using `@hookform/resolvers`.
- Use Ant Design's Form components for consistent form styling.

---

## ✅ Code Quality

- All components and functions must have proper TypeScript type definitions.
- Follow ESLint rules, including those provided by Next.js and TypeScript.
- Maintain consistent code formatting using Prettier.

---

## 🗂️ File & Folder Naming

- Use **PascalCase** for component filenames (e.g., `ButtonSample.tsx`).
- Use **kebab-case** for folder names (e.g., `button-sample/`).
- Use an underscore (`_`) prefix for folders excluded from routing (e.g., `_components`, `_lib`, `_apis`).
- Shared resources go into top-level folders under `src/`, while page-specific resources are placed in route-specific `_` folders.

## 📌 Summary

- **Shared resources** → `src/components/`, `src/apis/`, `src/utils/`, `src/constants/`
- **Page-specific resources** → `src/app/[route]/_components/`, `_lib/`, `_apis/`
- **UI Components** → **Ant Design first**, Tailwind CSS for custom styling
- **Design System** → Maintain consistency with Ant Design's design language
