# Good Job – AI Mock Interview Platform

## Project Rules for Next.js-based AI Mock Interview Service Development

---

## 📁 Project Structure & Architecture

- All page routing must be created under the `src/app/` directory.
- Common/shared resources should be placed in centralized folders:
    - `src/components/` → **Global UI components**
    - `src/apis/` → **Shared API functions**
    - `src/constants/` → **Global constants**
    - `src/utils/` → **Common utility functions (grouped by functionality)**

- Route-specific or feature-specific resources should be placed in underscore-prefixed folders within their respective route directories:
    - `src/app/users/_components/` → **Page-specific components**
    - `src/app/interview/_lib/` → **Page-specific utility functions**
    - `src/app/interview/_apis/` → **Page-specific API functions**

- Use `[id]` folder naming convention for dynamic routes.

---

## 🧠 State Management

- Client state is managed using `Zustand` (e.g., user authentication, UI state).
- Server state is managed using `@tanstack/react-query` (e.g., interview data, user profiles).
- Global context providers should be placed in the `src/providers/` directory.

---

## 📝 Form & Validation

- Use `react-hook-form` for all form handling.
- Define form validation rules using `Zod` schemas.
- Integrate Zod with React Hook Form using `@hookform/resolvers`.

---

## 🎨 Styling

- Tailwind CSS utility classes should be prioritized for styling.
- Custom styles may be defined in `globals.css`.
- Styling is processed through the PostCSS pipeline.

---

## ✅ Code Quality

- All components and functions must have proper TypeScript type definitions.
- Follow ESLint rules, including those provided by Next.js and TypeScript.
- Maintain consistent code formatting using Prettier.

---

## 🗂️ File & Folder Naming

- Use **PascalCase** for component filenames (e.g., `ButtonSample.tsx`).
- Use **kebab-case** for folder names (e.g., `button-sample/`).
- Use an underscore (`_`) prefix for folders excluded from routing (e.g., `_components`, `_lib`, `_apis`).
- Shared resources go into top-level folders under `src/`, while page-specific resources are placed in route-specific `_` folders.

---

## 📌 Summary

- **Shared resources** → `src/components/`, `src/apis/`, `src/utils/`, `src/constants/`
- **Page-specific resources** → `src/app/[route]/_components/`, `_lib/`, `_apis/`
